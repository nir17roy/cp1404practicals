CP1404 - Practical
Simulates the changing price of a stock for Capitalist Conrad.
The stock starts at $10.00 and changes each day:
- There's a 50% chance it increases by up to 17.5%
- There's a 50% chance it decreases by up to 5%
The simulation ends if the stock exceeds $100 or drops below $1.
Prices are rounded to the nearest cent.
