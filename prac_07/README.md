# Practical 07

## This practical focuses on working with classes, object-oriented programming, and file handling in Python.

##  Files

- **guitar.py**: Defines the `Guitar` class with attributes `name`, `year`, and `cost`, and methods like `__str__()` and `get_age()`.
- **guitar_test.py**: A simple test file to demonstrate and validate functionality of the `Guitar` class.
- **guitars.py**: A program to load guitar data from a file, let the user add new guitars, and save the updated list.
- **guitars.csv**: A sample data file storing guitars in comma-separated format.

##  Learning Objectives

- Practice creating and using Python classes.
- Apply class methods and string formatting.
- Work with file input/output and list processing.
- Use sorting and formatting when displaying data.

##  How to Use

1. Run `guitar_test.py` to verify the `Guitar` class.
2. Run `guitars.py` to load, display, and update the list of guitars from `guitars.csv`.

##  Requirements

- Python 3.10+
